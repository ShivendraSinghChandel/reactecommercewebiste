                <h4>ENGRAVING</h4>
                <p>Engraving offers laser cut precision, literally. We offer the ability to have your design laser engraved onto a synthetic leather fabric and laser-cut to patches which we then apply to your cap. This works with everything from simple lettering to very detailed logotypes and designs. The result of this technique is a very clean looking cap design with detail and durability.

The technique fits with almost all products and specially in combination with our suede visor products or cork visor products. Engraving also supports images and logos. Offering you the possibility to create clean looking caps with all types of artwork. </p>

            <h3>Custom Caps from Hatstore</h3>
            <p>At Hatstore, we offer you the opportunity to design your own cap. The caps that you can design come from Yupoong and Mitchell & Ness, ensuring the highest quality and a perfect fit. You can choose from several different caps, which differ in both the type of model and colour. Delivery time is very important for us. Therefore, we have the resources available to quickly produce your specially designed cap. This means that caps with personalised embroidery are delivered almost as quickly as our other caps.

                We embroider our caps using top quality and ultra-modern equipment, ensuring that your cap is embroidered to the highest standard. When you design your own cap at Hatstore, you can choose from various different colours and fonts. The text you choose is entirely up to your imagination and resourcefulness. Our Custom Made designs can include embroidery on the front, back and side. You can also add text on two lines. If there are any issues, we will assist you. Contact us directly and we will respond promptly to your questions on how to design your own hat or cap.

                You can easily create and design caps and beanies, based on your own requirements, using our online tool. Different fonts can be combined with motifs and different colours can be used. We continuously increase our range of motifs to provide greater options when you order your customised caps and beanies. Production is carried out using our modern embroidery machines and you can choose from among a variety of cap models, such as flexfit, snapback, trucker and adjustable. Popular ideas are caps with the individual’s name, personal jokes, event caps and more. Our caps come in different sizes and we also have kids caps and beanies for kids, all very popular. Using our online tool, it’s easy to design a kids cap with the child’s name or other design in any colour. The same text, name or design can then easily be applied to a kids’ beanie.</p>
            <h4>A cap or beanie with your own logo</h4>
            <p>Besides adding text or motifs, you can also upload your own logo or your personal design. This way, you can create your beanie or cap completely based on your own needs and get your own totally unique design. Using individual logos is very popular when making caps for specific organisations and clubs, as well as caps and beanies for sports teams. We use the latest technology when we embroider individual logos, ensuring a genuine feel of high quality. In other words, your own logotype on caps and beanies will have the same high quality as caps and beanies from the world’s leading fashion and sports brands.</p>
            <h4>Company promotion caps and branding caps</h4>
            <p>To have company promotion and branding caps designed and made up is a great way to drive marketing and visibility. We offer only caps and beanies from quality brands, meaning they can handle a lot more wear than low quality caps. It also means higher brand exposure and better return on investment. A great advantage with Hatstore is that we don’t impose minimum orders. You can order just one cap with your own logotype, as a sample or for your one-man company. With us, you can upload your own logo to create your own promotion and branding caps. We then put your caps into production using top quality caps and embroider them using the latest technology for the best result. Simply upload your own logotype to our configurator and choose your preferred thread colours. It’s never been easier to design your own caps with your personal embroidered logo. If you have any questions, our customer service is here to help.

We offer company promotion caps in all popular models such as snapback, flexfit, adjustable and trucker. You can combine your selections and mix models with different design styles. With the low minimum order volume, you can even get your branding caps individually customised if you, for example, want the company logo at the front and then the individual’s name on the side of the cap or beanie. If you are ordering more than 100 units of a product, please contact our customer service to obtain a quote.</p>
